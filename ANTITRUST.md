# Antitrust Policy

Participants acknowledge that they may compete with other participants in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws, competition laws, or associated regulations. This Policy does not restrict any participant from engaging in other similar projects. Each participant may design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it chooses. No participant is obligated to announce or market any products or services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, participants agree not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, contracts with third-parties, division or allocation of markets, geographic territories, or customers, or any other topic that relates in any way to limiting or lessening fair competition.
