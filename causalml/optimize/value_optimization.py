    Args
    ----
    treatment : array, shape = (num_samples, )
        An array of treatment group indicator values.

    control_name : string
        The name of the control condition as a string. Must be contained in the treatment array.

    treatment_names : list, length = cate.shape[1]
        A list of treatment group names. NB: The order of the items in the
        list must correspond to the order in which the conditional average
        treatment effect estimates are in cate_array.

    y_proba : array, shape = (num_samples, )
        The predicted probability of conversion using the Y ~ X model across
        the total sample.

    cate : array, shape = (num_samples, len(set(treatment)))
        Conditional average treatment effect estimations from any model.

    value : array, shape = (num_samples, )
        Value of converting each unit.

    conversion_cost : shape = (num_samples, len(set(treatment)))
        The cost of a treatment that is triggered if a unit converts after having been in the treatment, such as a promotion code.

    impression_cost : shape = (num_samples, len(set(treatment)))
       The cost of a treatment that is the same for each unit whether or not they convert, such as a cost associated with a promotion channel.


    Notes
    -----
    Because we get the conditional average treatment effects from
    cate-learners relative to the control condition, we subtract the
    cate for the unit in their actual treatment group from y_proba for that
    unit, in order to recover the control outcome. We then add the cates
    to the control outcome to obtain y_proba under each condition. These
    outcomes are counterfactual because just one of them is actually
    observed.
