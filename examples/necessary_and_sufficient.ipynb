    "\n",
    "* **Necessary**: If the customer doesn't get the voucher, they will not convert\n",

    "[Tian and Pearl (2000, p. 306)](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r271-A.pdf) imagine a setup where we have both experimental and observational data about the efficacy of a certain drug. The experimental data looks as follows:\n",

However, in addition to the experimental data, we also have the following data that is from an observational study, i.e. a study in which we simply observe the outcomes for those who choose to use the drug vs. those who don't:\n",

However, Tian and Pearl argue that the above two datasets can be combined to obtain information that is not visible by looking at either of the datasets independently, namely the probabilities of necessary and sufficient causation (PNS). More specifically, it is possible to derive bounds for PNS by combining the two data sources. To see how, let's generate the datasets:"

    "So, by combining experimental and observational data, we arrive at the conclusion that the participants who died and took the drug would have definitely survived without taking the drug. Those who survived and did not take the drug would have had between 0.2% and 3.1% risk of dying had they taken the drug. This illustrates how combining experimental and observational data can lead to additional insights compared to analysing either data source separately."
