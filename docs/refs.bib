  abstract = "Most classification approaches aim at achieving high prediction
              accuracy on a given dataset. However, in most practical cases,
              some action such as mailing an offer or treating a patient is to
              be taken on the classified objects, and we should model not the
              class probabilities themselves, but instead, the change in class
              probabilities caused by the action. The action should then be
              performed on those objects for which it will be most profitable.
              This problem is known as uplift modeling, differential response
              analysis, or true lift modeling, but has received very little
              attention in machine learning literature. An important
              modification of the problem involves several possible actions,
              when for each object, the model must also decide which action
              should be used in order to maximize profit. In this paper, we
              present tree-based classifiers designed for uplift modeling in
              both single and multiple treatment cases. To this end, we design
              new splitting criteria and pruning methods. The experiments

                   decision-making in many areas. They help people select the
                   optimal treatment for the test population with certain
                   statistical guarantee. However, subjects can show
                   significant heterogeneity in response to treatments. The
                   problem of customizing treatment assignment based on subject
                   characteristics is known as uplift modeling, differential
                   response analysis, or personalized treatment learning in
                   literature. A key feature for uplift modeling is that the
                   data is unlabeled. It is impossible to know whether the
                   chosen treatment is optimal for an individual subject
                   because response under alternative treatments is unobserved.
                   This presents a challenge to both the training and the
                   evaluation of uplift models. In this paper we describe how
                   to obtain an unbiased estimate of the key performance metric
                   of an uplift model, the expected response. We present a new
                   uplift algorithm which creates a forest of randomized trees.
                   The trees are built with a splitting criterion designed to
                   directly optimize their uplift performance based on the
                   proposed evaluation method. Both the evaluation method and
                   the algorithm apply to arbitrary number of treatments and
                   general response types. Experimental results on synthetic
                   data and industry-provided data show that our algorithm

abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. © 2015 The Authors.

    abstract = "{We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.}",
